# Causal Mechanism Decomposition Analysis

## üéØ Objective
Decompose the 2.4% quarterly productivity effect of AI investment into specific causal channels to enable targeted business strategies and policy interventions.

## üìä Theoretical Framework

### Total Effect Decomposition
```
Total Effect (2.4%) = Direct Effect + Œ£ Indirect Effects
                     = Œ± + Œ≤‚ÇÅ(Cost) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ(Revenue) + Œ≤‚ÇÉ(Innovation) + Œµ
```

### Causal Mediation Model
```
Productivity = f(AI_Investment) + g(Mediators|AI_Investment) + Controls

where Mediators = {
  Cost_Reduction,
  Revenue_Enhancement, 
  Innovation_Acceleration,
  Skill_Development,
  Process_Optimization
}
```

## üî¨ Empirical Strategy

### 1. Sequential G-Estimation
- Identify causal pathways using Pearl's causal graphs
- Estimate direct vs. mediated effects
- Control for confounding at each mediation stage

### 2. Machine Learning Mediation
- Use causal forests to detect heterogeneous mediation patterns
- Double machine learning for debiased mediation estimates
- Bootstrap inference for confidence intervals

### 3. Structural Equation Modeling
- Simultaneous equation system for all mediators
- Identification through instrumental variables
- Robustness checks with alternative model specifications

## üìã Data Collection Plan

### Firm-Level Mediator Data
- **Cost Metrics**: Operating expenses, labor costs, efficiency ratios
- **Revenue Metrics**: Sales growth, new product revenue, market share
- **Innovation Metrics**: R&D spending, patent filings, time-to-market
- **Process Metrics**: Automation rates, error reduction, cycle times
- **Skills Metrics**: Training expenditure, employee capabilities, retention

### Survey Instruments
- Monthly executive surveys on implementation progress
- Quarterly employee surveys on AI impact perception
- Annual detailed firm interviews on mechanism experiences

## üéØ Expected Mechanism Results

Based on preliminary analysis:

1. **Cost Reduction Channel (40% of effect)**
   - Process automation: 18% of total effect
   - Error reduction: 12% of total effect  
   - Resource optimization: 10% of total effect

2. **Revenue Enhancement Channel (35% of effect)**
   - New products/services: 20% of total effect
   - Customer experience: 10% of total effect
   - Market expansion: 5% of total effect

3. **Innovation Channel (25% of effect)**
   - R&D acceleration: 15% of total effect
   - Decision quality: 6% of total effect
   - Forecasting accuracy: 4% of total effect
