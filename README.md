## 🎯 Project Overview

This research project investigates how executive demographics (gender & age) affect AI investment decisions in Japanese firms, analyzing the impact of firm size on AI service implementation. Through comprehensive data analysis of major industry surveys and market research, we provide actionable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and technology providers.

### Key Research Questions
1. How do executive gender and age affect AI investment decisions in Japanese firms?
2. How does firm size influence AI service implementation decisions?
3. What are the productivity impacts by firm category?
4. How does Japan compare to other developed countries in AI investment patterns?

## 📊 Major Findings
